# client.delete

```
client.delete(...options) : Promise<Response> : throws
```

This method is available by default, but can be disable. The `delete()` method will start a `HTTP DELETE` request, using [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch), with the given options. It will return a [Promise]()https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise which resolves in a [Response](../response/README.md) on success.

This method is fully backwards compatible with the `fetch()` method, except the HTTP method is fixed to `DELETE`.
