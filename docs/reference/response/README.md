# metro.response

```
metro.response(...options) : Response
```

Returns a new response, built out of the options passed. Later option values override earlier values. 

Unlike the normal Response, you can set all available properties for a response, except `ok`. That is automatically derived from the status code.

You can set the body to any supported type, and additionally to a normal Object. The body will still report as a ReadableStream, but you can iterate over it like it was just a normal Object. e.g:

```javascript
const res = metro.response({
	status: 200,
	statusText: 'OK',
	body: {
		data: 'some data'
	}
})

const data = res.body.data
```

Creating responses from scratch is not usually needed, except when creating mock responses for testing or when enhancing responses in a middleware component. In that case the [`with()`](./with.md) comes in handy.
